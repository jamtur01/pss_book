# Building a Software Security Program #

This section will provide project leaders and development managers a blue-print to build and manage their own software security program. Starting with requirements, design & planning and a description of how to implement security into application architecture we will then cover secure coding, testing and QA, ‘DevOps’, security standards and regulations, education and awareness, dealing with 3rd parties like vendors partners and auditors and finally outsourcing. The section will also discuss tools for security including the obvious security code analysis type tools but also specifically focusing on adapting common development tools like Behavior Driven Development tools towards security tasks. The section will end with detailed description on how security fits into modern agile and test driven development practices and how security metrics (like “Coder Metrics”) can be used to drive continuous improvement.
